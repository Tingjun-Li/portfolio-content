			<h2 class="subtitle">Olympic Game Farm</h2>
			<p>
                Located at 1423 Ward Road, the Olympic Game Farm is home to many species of animals, 
				including veterans of the silver screen. Tourists can feed the yaks from their vehicles 
				on the self-guided driving tour.<br><br>

				According to <a href="https://www.visitsunnysequim.com/122/Olympic-Game-Farm"> Sequim Washington</a>,
				the Olympic Game Farm worked exclusively for Walt Disney Studios for 28 years and 
				the farm's animal actors have been featured in the Grizzly Adams television and movie series, 
				The Incredible Journey, Charlie the Lonesome Cougar, and more. The farm includes a petting 
				farm and freshwater aquarium. A popular destination for all ages!<br><br>

				Before entering the Olympic Game Farm, we purchased two loafs of bread that could be used to feed the
				animals inside the zoo. We met so many animals, including elks, bisons, peacock, lama etc. The animals
				inside were so enthusastic that they ran to us immediately once they smelt the scent of bread. We had 
				a lot of fun inside<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle">Olympic National Park</h2>
			<p>
                One of the most famouse scenic view in Olympic National Park is the Hurricane Ridge. It is 
				the most easily accessed mountain area within Olympic National Park. In clear weather, 
				fantastic views can be enjoyed throughout the year. <br><br>
				
				The views on top of the Hurricane Ridge were spectacular. We could see the whole Olympic National Park.
				The weather was so nice that we could see mountains after mountains that were all dressed in green. We could 
				even spot a harbor that belongs to Canada when we were walking along a trial. The view was so beautiful that
				we could not stop taking pictures. <br><br>

		<p><strong>Q: How long does it take to travel from Seattle downtown to the Olympic national park?</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p>
			A: There are two main routes to get there. One is to take travel purely on the ground, while the other is 
			to take a ferry to Bainbridge Island and then drive to the park. Interestingly, both of them takes approximately
			the same time, 2.5 hours. The ferry is a little bit more expensive, but it is a more scenic route, especially during
			the night.
