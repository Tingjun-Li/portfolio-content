			<p>
                Located at 1423 Ward Road, the Olympic Game Farm is home to many species of animals, 
				including veterans of the silver screen. Tourists can feed the yaks from their vehicles 
				on the self-guided driving tour.<br><br>

				According to <a href="https://www.visitsunnysequim.com/122/Olympic-Game-Farm"> Sequim Washington</a>,
				the Olympic Game Farm worked exclusively for Walt Disney Studios for 28 years and 
				the farm's animal actors have been featured in the Grizzly Adams television and movie series, 
				The Incredible Journey, Charlie the Lonesome Cougar, and more. The farm includes a petting 
				farm and freshwater aquarium. A popular destination for all ages!<br><br>
