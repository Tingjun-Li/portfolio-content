		<h1>Life in Seattle</h1>
		<article>
			<h2>My neighborhood</h2>
			<p>
                This summer, I was doing an internship as a production engineer at Meta Platforms, Inc.
                The company offered me a coorporate housing during the summer and it was on Pike Street. It was very different from Ann Arbor, where I am pursuing
                my Master's Degree. This area is very modernized and it has a whole bunch of 
                restaurants and tall buildings. One can also find great theatres, shopping malls and 
                enjoyable cinemas in this place. <br><br>
                [I want to add more details about some restaurants and cinema later]

			<h2>Lake Union in Seattle</h2>
			<p>
                [I want to add an introduction about the lake]<br><br>

                One thing I noticed in Seatlle is that many local people love to bring their
                kayaks or paddle boards to the lake during nice days. Even there are many motorized
                boats driving on the lake, they can still find a spot to fit in and enjoy their weekend.
                During one weekend, I was hanging out with my friends on a rental yacht, and the captain told
                us that Lakes in Seattle are always so crowded due to high volume of all kinds of boats.
                Thus, it was not safe to just jump into the water and start swimming in some areas.<br>
