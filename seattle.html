				This summer, I was doing an internship as a production engineer at Meta Platforms, Inc.
				The company offered me a coorporate housing during the summer and it was on Pike Street. It was very different
				from Ann Arbor, where I am pursuing
				my Master's Degree. This area is very modernized and it has a whole bunch of
				restaurants and tall buildings. One can also find great theatres, shopping malls and
				enjoyable cinemas in this place. <br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle">Lake Union in Seattle</h2>
			<p>
				One thing I noticed in Seatlle is that many local people love to bring their
				kayaks or paddle boards to the lake during nice days. Even there are many motorized
				boats driving on the lake, they can still find a spot to fit in and enjoy their weekend.
				During one weekend, I was hanging out with my friends on a rental yacht, and the captain told
				us that Lakes in Seattle are always so crowded due to high volume of all kinds of boats.
				Thus, it was not safe to just jump into the water and start swimming in some areas.<br><br>

		<p><strong>Q: How long does it take to travel from Seattle downtown to the Olympic national park?</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p>
			A: There are two main routes to get there. One is to take travel purely on the ground, while the other is
			to take a ferry to Bainbridge Island and then drive to the park. Interestingly, both of them takes approximately
			the same time, 2.5 hours. The ferry is a little bit more expensive, but it is a more scenic route, especially
			during the night.
